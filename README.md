## Tech

Simple Browser uses pure Java JDK. It's written in Java 8 and SimpleBrowser is an open source project on GitHub.

I must say that, Simple Browser might be needed some modified for never versions of Java 9 because of reflection. Take a look at it [here.][reflectionAccess]

### Installation

As mentioned above, Simple Browser needs Java JDK. We didn't test on before versions of Java 8 so not sure if its work on earlier version of Java 8.


Install Java SDK and set enviroments.(JAVA_HOME)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YeniNesilARGE/SimpleBrowser.git
$ cd SimpleBrowser
```
Compile java classes..

```sh
$ JAVA_HOME=jdk path
$ ./build.sh
```

Collect the compiled classes into JAR file..

```sh
$ ./makeJar.sh
$ java -jar simple-browser.jar
```

Applicaitons configuration..

Simple Browser has some built in applications and configurations. Create a directory in home directory named 'yna' and copy application configurations to the created directory
```sh
$ mkdir ~/yna
$ cd built-in apps
$ cp Calendar.app ~/yna
$ cp Paint.app ~/yna
$ cp Reditor.app ~/yna
$ cp VideoPlayer.app ~/yna
```

### Todos
 - PaintApplication has some problems when using redo. Sometimes redos two drawings at a time which must redo one at a time.
